    The series is set in a world where Swift exists
and has been utilized as a technology. Q! Rather
than casting spells with chants or other traditional
forms of spellcasting, programmers use a Casting
Assistant Device, better known as a CAD. Programmers
infuse the CAD with Xcode, a substanceless particle
and psychic phenomenon.
